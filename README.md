| Mario Vidov | Hi there 👋 |

| ![Mario Vidov](me.png) | I'm a Bulgarian 🇧🇬 &nbsp;based full stack developer 👨🏻‍💻 &nbsp;with over a decade of hands-on experience working for a variety of forward-looking ⏩ &nbsp;brands. <br /> Occasionally sub-contracting for Fortune 500 companies and enterprise clients 🏢 &nbsp; in need of an expert, elegant solution ✔️ &nbsp;to difficult problems. <br /> Starting in the mid-2000s with web development contracts and moving to senior full-time 🕗 &nbsp;positions, I've picked up a unique blend of skills 🔧&nbsp; and technologies ⚙️ &nbsp;along the way. <br /> I can confidently say that I would be an ideal addition to a team looking to ship 🚢 &nbsp;efficient code and get remarkable products in their customer's hands 👋&nbsp;. |
